# Round 3 Scraping Code

The initial scraping/crawling process is divided into several rounds. This folder contains the code and output from the third round, which runs a direct google search that include terms like "chargemaster" and "price list" and then scrape those pages to 1-layer using the `scrapy` crawling framework.

## File Descriptions
- The `scrapy_price` folder and the `scrapy.cfg` file are the core structures needed for the scrapy framework. Most are created by default, except for the `search_spider.py` file in `./scrapy_price/spiders`, which defines the crawler used for this round.

- `1.google_search.py` searches google using: 'hospital-name'+'city'+ 'keywords' where 'keywords' include a number of terms related to pricing sheets. It returns the first few google hits, which are then saved to a hospital-specific csv file in the `urls` folder. You need to create your own API. The one in the file is an old disabled one.

- `2.get_filelocations.py` calls the spider defined in `./scrapy_price/spiders/search_spider.py` to scrape the url location of csv/excel files 1 layer deep of the websites defined in the hospital-specific csv files in the `urls` folder. It saves the location into a hospital-specific csv file in `file_locations`.

- `urls` contains files corresponding to each hospital of the top google hits from the search run by `1.google_search.py`. The full folder can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/msxmyhr7tcr0pmu/AAAm1q0RE5ZrCo68T_QdoOnwa?dl=0).

- `file_locations` contains files corresponding to each hospital in which the url location of the found csv/excel file is stored. The full folder can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/v7tq3p7x219f1xa/AABzqU7Z9TXpdSdNPqojpMhYa?dl=0).

- `downloaded_files` contains files contains folders corresponding to each hospital in which the scraped files from that hospital is stored. There are too many files to upload here, but they can be downloaded from [this dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pe848o7ms1g12yg/AADR3Zjk3p-Cup5KeDe_606Ca?dl=0).
